# Contributing to Paw Control

- Code style follows Home Assistant integrations (async, typing).
- Run Ruff (`ruff check`) and GitHub Actions locally where possible (hassfest, HACS validation).
- Ruff rules are configured in `pyproject.toml` under `[tool.ruff.lint]`.
- PRs should include a short test plan and screenshots for UI changes.
