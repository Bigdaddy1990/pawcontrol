# Contributing to PawControl

Thank you for your interest in improving the PawControl integration. This guide explains how you can deliver high-quality contributions quickly and confidently.

## Know the quality expectations
- PawControl tracks progress against the Home Assistant integration quality scale in `custom_components/pawcontrol/quality_scale.yaml`.
- Review that file before you start so you understand which requirements are complete, exempt, or still marked as TODO.
- When you finish a requirement or claim an exemption, update the quality scale file and include a short comment that explains the change.

## Set up your environment
1. Use Python 3.12 or newer.
2. Fork the repository and create a feature branch for each contribution.
3. Create a virtual environment and install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `.venv\\Scripts\\activate`
   pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements_test.txt
   pip install -U homeassistant pytest-homeassistant-custom-component
   pip install -U ruff mypy pre-commit pytest pytest-asyncio pytest-cov
   pre-commit install --install-hooks
   ```

4. Install any additional tooling you need for documentation or translation updates.

## Follow development guidelines
- Write asynchronous, fully typed code and prefer modern Python features such as pattern matching, dataclasses, and `ConfigEntry.runtime_data`.
- Reuse shared helpers under `custom_components/pawcontrol/` and constants from `homeassistant.const` instead of hardcoding values.
- Keep all user-facing text in American English, use sentence case for headings, and speak to the user in second-person voice.
- Update or add tests under `tests/` for every behavior change so coverage stays above the threshold defined in `pyproject.toml`.
- Revise documentation, release notes, and translations (for example files in `docs/`, `README.md`, and `custom_components/pawcontrol/translations/`) whenever behavior or options change.

## Run local checks
Run the same checks that continuous integration executes before you open a pull request:

```bash
ruff format custom_components/pawcontrol tests
ruff check custom_components/pawcontrol tests
mypy custom_components/pawcontrol
pytest --cov=custom_components/pawcontrol tests
pre-commit run --all-files
python -m hassfest  # Available via the Home Assistant hassfest tool or the hassfest PyPI package
```

If you have Home Assistant Core tooling available, also run the HACS validation (`hacs action --category integration`) to mirror the `hacs.yml` workflow. Fix any reported issues before you submit your changes.

## Submit your pull request
- Fill out the pull request template, describe the intent of your change, and link any related issues.
- Include a concise test plan listing the commands you ran. Attach screenshots or recordings for UI-visible updates.
- Keep commits focused and explain documentation, code, and translation updates in your summary.
- Stay involved after opening the pull request by responding to feedback and rebasing on `main` until your contribution merges.

We appreciate your help making PawControl better for every pet family!
