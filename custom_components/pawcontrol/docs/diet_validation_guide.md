# Diet Validation & Health-Aware Feeding Guide

**PawControl Integration | Home Assistant 2025.9.0+ | Quality Scale: Platinum**

This comprehensive guide explains how PawControl's intelligent diet validation system works with health-aware feeding to ensure optimal nutrition for your dog while preventing potentially harmful diet combinations.

## üéØ Overview

PawControl's health-aware feeding system analyzes your dog's special diet requirements and automatically:
- ‚úÖ **Validates diet combinations** for safety and compatibility
- üîç **Detects conflicts** between incompatible diets (e.g., puppy vs senior formulas)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Issues warnings** for combinations requiring veterinary supervision
- üìä **Adjusts portion sizes** based on validation results and health conditions
- ü©∫ **Recommends veterinary consultation** when needed

## üìã Special Diet Options

PawControl supports 14 special diet categories with intelligent compatibility checking:

### üè• Medical/Prescription Diets
| Diet Type | Description | Adjustment Factor | Monitoring Level |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|------------------|
| `prescription` | Veterinary prescription diets | 0.9x (conservative) | High |
| `diabetic` | Diabetic management formula | 0.85x (controlled) | High |
| `kidney_support` | Kidney disease support | 0.9x (phosphorus control) | High |
| `low_fat` | Low-fat therapeutic diet | 0.9x (calorie adjustment) | Medium |
| `weight_control` | Weight management formula | 0.85x (calorie restriction) | Medium |

### üë∂üë¥ Age-Specific Diets
| Diet Type | Description | Adjustment Factor | Age Compatibility |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| `puppy_formula` | Growth & development | 1.15x (high energy) | 0-18 months |
| `senior_formula` | Senior nutritional needs | 0.95x (easier digestion) | 7+ years |

### üö´ Allergy/Sensitivity Diets
| Diet Type | Description | Adjustment Factor | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|-------|
| `grain_free` | No grains/cereals | 1.0x (neutral) | Monitor for DCM |
| `hypoallergenic` | Limited ingredient diet | 1.0x (neutral) | Requires careful selection |
| `sensitive_stomach` | Easy digestion formula | 0.95x (frequent meals) | Small, frequent portions |

### üå± Lifestyle/Care Diets
| Diet Type | Description | Adjustment Factor | Benefits |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|----------|
| `organic` | Certified organic ingredients | 1.0x (neutral) | Quality focus |
| `raw_diet` | Raw/BARF feeding | 1.0x (natural) | Requires handling care |
| `dental_care` | Dental health formula | 1.0x (neutral) | Plaque reduction |
| `joint_support` | Glucosamine/chondroitin | 1.05x (activity support) | Mobility enhancement |

## ‚ö° Diet Validation Rules

### üî¥ Conflicts (Automatic Portion Reduction: -10%)

#### Age-Exclusive Conflicts
```yaml
Conflict: puppy_formula + senior_formula
Reason: Age-specific nutritional needs are mutually exclusive
Action: 10% portion reduction + veterinary consultation required
Example: "Max cannot have both puppy and senior formulas"
```

#### Weight Management Conflicts
```yaml
Conflict: weight_control + puppy_formula
Reason: Weight restriction conflicts with growth needs
Action: 5% portion increase (prioritizes puppy growth)
Warning: Requires careful veterinary monitoring
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Warnings (Conservative Portion Adjustments: -2% to -5%)

#### Multiple Prescription Warning
```yaml
Warning: prescription + diabetic + kidney_support
Reason: Multiple therapeutic diets need coordination
Action: 5% portion reduction for safety
Recommendation: Veterinary nutritionist consultation
```

#### Raw Diet Medical Warning
```yaml
Warning: raw_diet + [kidney_support|diabetic|prescription]
Reason: Raw feeding with medical conditions needs monitoring
Action: 5% portion reduction + enhanced safety protocols
Recommendation: Regular veterinary check-ups
```

#### Complex Diet Warning
```yaml
Warning: 4+ special diet requirements
Reason: High complexity increases interaction risk
Action: 3% portion reduction + systematic monitoring
Recommendation: Professional nutrition consultation
```

## üìä Portion Adjustment Calculation

### Base Calculation Formula
```python
# 1. Calculate base daily calories
daily_calories = base_metabolic_rate √ó life_stage_factor √ó activity_multiplier

# 2. Apply health condition adjustments
adjusted_calories = daily_calories √ó health_condition_factors

# 3. Apply diet validation adjustments
final_calories = adjusted_calories √ó diet_validation_factor

# 4. Convert to portion size
portion_grams = final_calories √∑ food_calories_per_gram √∑ meals_per_day
```

### Example Calculation: Senior Dog with Diabetes

**Dog Profile:**
- Weight: 18kg, Age: 9 years, Activity: Low
- Health: Diabetes, Arthritis
- Diet: `senior_formula` + `diabetic` + `joint_support`

**Step-by-Step:**
```python
# 1. Base Calculation
base_calories = 70 √ó (18kg)^0.75 √ó 0.85 (senior) √ó 0.9 (low activity)
             = 70 √ó 9.17 √ó 0.85 √ó 0.9 = 492 kcal/day

# 2. Health Conditions
health_adjusted = 492 √ó 0.9 (diabetes) √ó 0.9 (arthritis) = 398 kcal/day

# 3. Diet Validation (multiple prescription warning)
diet_adjusted = 398 √ó 0.95 (prescription warning) = 378 kcal/day

# 4. Portion Size (2 meals/day, 3.5 kcal/g)
portion_size = 378 √∑ 3.5 √∑ 2 = 54g per meal
```

## üîß Configuration Examples

### Example 1: Senior Dog with Arthritis
```yaml
dog_config:
  name: "Buddy"
  age_months: 108  # 9 years
  weight: 22.0
  ideal_weight: 20.0
  special_diet:
    - senior_formula
    - joint_support
    - low_fat
  health_conditions:
    - arthritis
  weight_goal: "lose"

# Result: No conflicts, good compatibility
# Adjustment: -15% (weight loss) + -5% (low fat) = 0.8x total
```

### Example 2: Complex Medical Case
```yaml
dog_config:
  name: "Luna"
  age_months: 84  # 7 years
  weight: 15.0
  special_diet:
    - prescription
    - diabetic
    - kidney_support
    - hypoallergenic
  health_conditions:
    - diabetes
    - kidney_disease
    - allergies

# Result: Multiple prescription warning
# Adjustment: -10% (diabetes) + -15% (kidney) + -5% (prescription warning) = 0.72x
# Recommendation: Veterinary nutritionist consultation
```

### Example 3: Puppy Growth Conflict
```yaml
dog_config:
  name: "Charlie"
  age_months: 8  # Young puppy
  weight: 12.0
  ideal_weight: 10.0  # Overweight puppy
  special_diet:
    - puppy_formula
    - weight_control  # CONFLICT!

# Result: Age conflict detected + weight puppy warning
# Adjustment: +15% (puppy needs) + 5% (growth priority) = 1.2x
# Recommendation: Immediate veterinary consultation for growth vs weight management
```

## üö® Safety Guidelines

### Red Flags - Stop and Consult Vet
- üõë **Multiple conflicts detected**
- üõë **Portion calculations extremely low (<40g for medium dog)**
- üõë **Rapid weight changes with complex diets**
- üõë **New medical symptoms with diet changes**

### Best Practices
- ‚úÖ **Start with single special diet** when possible
- ‚úÖ **Introduce diet changes gradually** (7-10 days)
- ‚úÖ **Monitor weight weekly** during diet transitions
- ‚úÖ **Keep feeding logs** for veterinary consultations
- ‚úÖ **Regular blood work** for prescription diets

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

#### "Portion seems too small"
```yaml
Check:
  - Body condition score (should be 4-6)
  - Activity level settings
  - Multiple restrictive diets
  - Health condition adjustments

Solution:
  - Verify dog measurements
  - Consider higher calorie food
  - Increase meal frequency
  - Consult veterinarian
```

#### "Compatibility score low"
```yaml
Check:
  - Conflicting diet combinations
  - Age-inappropriate diets
  - Too many special requirements

Solution:
  - Remove non-essential diets
  - Prioritize medical requirements
  - Seek nutritionist guidance
  - Consider prescription diet simplification
```

#### "Vet consultation recommended"
```yaml
Prepare for consultation:
  - Current feeding schedule
  - Portion calculation details
  - Weight history
  - Any symptoms or concerns
  - Complete diet list

Bring:
  - PawControl feeding reports
  - Health tracking data
  - Current food labels
```
