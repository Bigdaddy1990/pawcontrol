# Current issues blocking full compliance
blockers:
  - "Missing automated tests (Bronze requirement)"
  - "No active code owners defined (Silver requirement)" 
  - "Missing automatic discovery implementation (Gold requirement)"
  - "Incomplete translation support (Gold requirement)"
  - "Missing comprehensive test coverage (Gold requirement)"

# Next steps for full Platinum compliance
next_steps:
  1. "Implement comprehensive test suite"
  2. "Add discovery configuration"
  3. "Complete translation files"
  4. "Define active code owners"
  5. "Validate all quality scale requirements"
