# Issues blocking higher tiers
silver_blockers:
  - "Only one code owner (@BigDaddy1990) instead of multiple active owners"
  - "Test coverage below 95% requirement"
  - "No troubleshooting documentation"

gold_blockers:
  - "Discovery update info not implemented (DHCP/USB/Zeroconf configured but incomplete)"
  - "German translations are copy-paste of English (fake translations)"
  - "No extensive user documentation"
  - "Comprehensive test coverage missing"

# Next steps for BRONZE compliance (IMMEDIATE PRIORITY)
immediate_actions:
  1. "Implement comprehensive test suite (config flow, entities, services)"
  2. "Create integration documentation (README, installation guide)"
  3. "Add proper German translations (not copy-paste)"
  4. "Implement discovery update info for configured protocols"
  5. "Define multiple active code owners"
  6. "Create troubleshooting documentation"
  7. "Achieve 95%+ test coverage"

# Long-term goals (after BRONZE achieved)
long_term_goals:
  1. "Achieve Silver tier with proper code ownership and test coverage"
  2. "Achieve Gold tier with full discovery and translations"
  3. "Consider Platinum tier only after Gold is solid"
