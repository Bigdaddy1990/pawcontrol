## 🧹 Removal & Cleanup

Follow these steps to uninstall PawControl cleanly:

1. **Remove integration entry**
   - Navigate to **Settings → Devices & Services → PawControl**
   - Open the integration and choose **Delete** to remove the config entry and associated entities

2. **Delete helpers and dashboards**
   - PawControl creates helpers under **Settings → Devices & Services → Helpers** prefixed with your dog names
   - Remove any `input_*`, `script.`, or `automation.` entries that were created for PawControl workflows
   - Delete Lovelace dashboards named `pawcontrol-*` if they were auto-generated

3. **Clean up files (if manually installed)**
   - Delete the `custom_components/pawcontrol/` directory from your Home Assistant configuration
   - Restart Home Assistant to purge cached translations and services

4. **Optional: Remove brand assets**
   - If brand assets were copied manually for testing, remove `www/community/pawcontrol/` or other staging folders

After restart, confirm that no PawControl entities remain in the entity registry and that services under `pawcontrol.*` are no longer listed in the developer tools panel.
