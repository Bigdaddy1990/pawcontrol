# Compliance Review – 2025-03-03

This follow-up review confirms that Paw Control sustains the **Platinum**
quality tier. Evidence for every Platinum requirement is present in the
repository and is referenced by the documentation portal.

## Highlights
- **Quality evidence** – Manifest, README, changelog, and release notes advertise the Platinum declaration and point to the synchronised tracker in `custom_components/pawcontrol/quality_scale.yaml`.
- **Service documentation** – Feeding, garden, weather, resilience, and notification services are documented in `services.yaml`, README, and the automation guides with matching handler tests.
- **Coverage status** – CI and local workflows enforce `pytest -q` with the 100% coverage floor defined in `pyproject.toml`, spanning unit, component, and end-to-end suites.
- **Lifecycle hooks** – `async_remove_config_entry_device`, reload paths, and dynamic entity recreation are covered by targeted tests ensuring active dogs remain intact during cleanup.
- **Sustainment** – `docs/MAINTENANCE.md` and `dev.md` outline the Platinum sustainment cadence, including evidence refreshes and telemetry sync.
