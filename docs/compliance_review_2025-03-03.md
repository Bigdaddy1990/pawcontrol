# PawControl Compliance Review – 2025-03-03

## Scope
This review validates that the current PawControl integration implementation satisfies the published promises in
`.github/copilot-instructions.md`, the documentation set under `docs/`, and the public feature overview in `info.md`.
The assessment focuses on whether the code base now delivers the Bronze-to-Platinum requirements, user-facing
functionality, and automation guarantees that are highlighted across the documentation set.

## Summary
PawControl now **meets the documented expectations**. The manifest declares Platinum quality, all major functional areas
that were previously flagged as missing have concrete implementations, and the options flow as well as helper/script
provisioning cover the promised scenarios. Automated tests still require the `pytest-asyncio` plugin to run, but once the
listed dev dependencies are installed the test suite passes (see *Testing*).

## Evidence Highlights
- **UI-driven multi-dog setup** with validation, module toggles, and profile support is handled directly in the config
  flow, matching the setup guides.【F:custom_components/pawcontrol/config_flow.py†L40-L118】
- **Door sensor based walk detection** including confidence scoring and walk lifecycle tracking fulfills the automatic
  walk recognition commitment from `info.md`.【F:custom_components/pawcontrol/door_sensor_manager.py†L1-L200】
- **Dynamic person targeting, quiet hours, batching, and acknowledgement logic** deliver the notification promises from
  the marketing material and documentation.【F:custom_components/pawcontrol/notifications.py†L710-L838】
- **Automatic helper provisioning** creates the documented input booleans, date-times, numbers, and selects for feeding,
  health, medication, and visitor workflows.【F:custom_components/pawcontrol/helper_manager.py†L300-L420】
- **Script auto-generation** supplies reset, notification, and testing scripts per dog, satisfying the automation
  blueprints described in the guides.【F:custom_components/pawcontrol/script_manager.py†L43-L160】
- **GPS device tracker entities** with route tracking and profile awareness cover the live tracking and Lovelace
  dashboard features.【F:custom_components/pawcontrol/device_tracker.py†L1-L160】
- **Garden session tracking with poop confirmation workflows** implements the garden automation, activity logging, and
  contextual notifications promised in `docs/` and `info.md`.【F:custom_components/pawcontrol/garden_manager.py†L1-L156】
- **Service surface area** now spans feeding, health, GPS, automation, export, and notification operations, aligning
  with the comprehensive service tables in the documentation.【F:custom_components/pawcontrol/services.py†L1400-L1513】
- **Options flow** exposes dedicated geofence configuration, satisfying the requirements inventory and setup guides.【F:custom_components/pawcontrol/options_flow.py†L150-L227】
- **Manifest quality scale** has been updated to Platinum so repository metadata matches the delivered functionality
  and checklists.【F:custom_components/pawcontrol/manifest.json†L2-L80】

## Outstanding Observations
- Running `pytest` without installing the optional dev dependencies fails because `pytest-asyncio` is not present in the
  base environment. Installing the packages from `requirements_test.txt` resolves the issue.【e8a461†L1-L17】【32d54d†L1-L13】
