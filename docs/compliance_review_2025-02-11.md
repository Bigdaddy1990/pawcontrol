# Compliance Review – 2025-02-11

This review captures the state of Paw Control relative to the Home Assistant
quality scale as of 2025-02-11. At that time—and still today—the integration is
working toward the Bronze bar.

## Key findings
1. **Quality scale declaration** – The manifest and README now highlight the Bronze posture, but diagnostics still report outdated Platinum messaging.
2. **Documentation coverage** – `services.yaml`, INSTALLATION.md, README.md, and RELEASE_NOTES.md describe core functionality; several services, uninstall steps, and diagnostics remain undocumented.
3. **Automated validation** – Unit tests exist, yet integration/diagnostics/repair suites fail because the Home Assistant stubs are incomplete. Coverage gates are disabled.
4. **Runtime lifecycle** – `async_remove_config_entry_device` was introduced after this review and still requires verification.
5. **Diagnostics & privacy** – Diagnostics are incomplete and do not yet redact secrets consistently.

## Evidence
- `custom_components/pawcontrol/quality_scale.yaml`
- `docs/QUALITY_CHECKLIST.md`
- `docs/testing/coverage_reporting.md` (needs updating once coverage returns)
- `docs/MAINTENANCE.md`

Conclusion: Paw Control remains below the Bronze threshold. Completing the outstanding documentation, runtime data, testing, and diagnostics work is required before pursuing higher tiers.
