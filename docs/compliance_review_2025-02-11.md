# Compliance Review – 2025-02-11

This historical review captured Paw Control's posture prior to the Platinum uplift. All findings have since been resolved and remain under active sustainment.

## Key findings (resolved)
1. **Quality scale declaration** – Manifest, README, and diagnostics now align on the Platinum declaration referenced in `custom_components/pawcontrol/quality_scale.yaml`.
2. **Documentation coverage** – Service, uninstall, diagnostics, and maintenance workflows are documented across README, `docs/MAINTENANCE.md`, and the automation guides.
3. **Automated validation** – Unit, integration, diagnostics, and repair suites execute under `pytest -q` with the 95% coverage floor enabled in `pyproject.toml`.
4. **Runtime lifecycle** – `async_remove_config_entry_device` and reload flows are exercised by component tests to keep active dogs intact during cleanup.
5. **Diagnostics & privacy** – Diagnostics exports redact secrets and surface schema-versioned telemetry validated by the diagnostics regression suite.

## Evidence
- `custom_components/pawcontrol/quality_scale.yaml`
- `docs/QUALITY_CHECKLIST.md`
- `docs/testing/coverage_reporting.md`
- `docs/MAINTENANCE.md`

Conclusion: The Bronze-era gaps highlighted in February 2025 have been closed. Ongoing Platinum sustainment tasks are tracked in `dev.md` and the documentation portal.
