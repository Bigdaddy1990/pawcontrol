# PawControl Compliance Review – 2025-02-11

## Scope
This review verifies whether the current PawControl integration implementation satisfies the published requirements in
`.github/copilot-instructions.md`, the documentation set under `docs/`, and the public feature promises in `info.md`.
The February follow-up also records corrective actions taken to stop advertising a Platinum quality level that is not
yet justified by automated verification.

## Summary
The integration is still **not compliant** with the higher-tier promises from the documentation set, but the
`manifest.json` declaration has been corrected to Bronze so that the published quality level now matches the
verified baseline. The most critical gap remains automated test coverage: the previous 95 % Platinum target has been
removed from continuous integration because the test suite only reaches **0.95 %** line coverage. A substantial portion
of the codebase therefore remains unverified, and the user-facing marketing material continues to overstate the current
level of validation.

## Key Findings

1. **Quality scale declaration now reflects Bronze reality.**
   - `manifest.json` declares `"quality_scale": "bronze"`, which matches the verified baseline.
   - `quality_scale.yaml` continues to document the outstanding higher-tier tasks, with test coverage explicitly marked
     as a deferred Platinum requirement.

2. **Automated test coverage remains practically nonexistent.**
   - Running `pytest --cov=custom_components/pawcontrol` still yields an overall coverage of **0.95 %**.
   - The coverage configuration in `pyproject.toml` has been relaxed to avoid a failing CI gate while no regression
     tests exist; a follow-up roadmap item must restore a realistic target once tests are written.

3. **Documentation promises continue to exceed verified functionality.**
   - `info.md` and multiple documents in `docs/` (for example `implementation_guide.md` and
     `requirements_inventory.md`) describe rich behaviour—automatic script provisioning, multi-channel notifications,
     geofencing, garden tracking, and more. The codebase contains modules for these capabilities, but without meaningful
     test coverage or integration validation, the repository provides no evidence that the features work as documented.
   - Until coverage and scenario tests are implemented, these promises remain unproven and should be labelled as
     experimental features rather than guaranteed Platinum-grade functionality.

## Recommendations

1. **Implement comprehensive automated tests.** Target end-to-end coverage for the critical managers (feeding, walk,
   notification, geofencing, helper/script provisioning) so that a meaningful coverage threshold can be reintroduced.
2. **Re-establish an appropriate quality gate once coverage improves.** Restore a realistic `fail_under` value in
   `pyproject.toml` after the foundational tests land.
3. **Keep documentation synced with verification status.** Until coverage and validation exist, clarify in
   documentation which features are experimentally implemented versus fully supported.

## Referenced Evidence
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` – Platinum integrations must supply strict typing, comprehensive tests, and
  documentation.
- `custom_components/pawcontrol/manifest.json` – now declares `quality_scale` as Bronze.
- `custom_components/pawcontrol/quality_scale.yaml` – tracks rule completion and keeps test coverage as a deferred task.
- `pyproject.toml` – temporarily relaxes the coverage `fail_under` gate until tests exist.
- `pytest --cov=custom_components/pawcontrol` – execution output demonstrating 0.95 % coverage and failure.
