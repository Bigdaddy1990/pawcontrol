# PawControl Integration Analysis Report
## Home Assistant 2025.9.1+ Compatibility Assessment

### Executive Summary
The PawControl integration now targets the Home Assistant **Bronze** quality baseline while maintaining compatibility with 2025.9.1+ APIs. Runtime data is attached directly to `ConfigEntry.runtime_data` with migration fallbacks, the coordinator exposes a public setup hook for config entries, and asynchronous helpers remain in place. Documentation has been realigned to reflect the in-progress Bronze status instead of overstating Platinum compliance.

### Validated Compliance Improvements

1. **Runtime data lifecycle** – Config entry data is persisted through `store_runtime_data` and retrieved via `get_runtime_data`, both of which now favor `ConfigEntry.runtime_data` while transparently migrating any legacy `hass.data[DOMAIN]` entries.【F:custom_components/pawcontrol/runtime_data.py†L13-L168】【F:custom_components/pawcontrol/__init__.py†L696-L1017】
2. **Coordinator initialization contract** – `async_setup_entry` now awaits the public `PawControlCoordinator.async_prepare_entry()` helper with a timeout guard, so setup no longer depends on the private `_async_setup` coroutine.【F:custom_components/pawcontrol/__init__.py†L360-L407】【F:custom_components/pawcontrol/coordinator.py†L248-L284】
3. **Async dependency parity** – GPX exports continue to use an inline serializer on the event loop and the manifest limits requirements to async-friendly packages, keeping I/O behaviour Bronze-ready.【F:custom_components/pawcontrol/walk_manager.py†L1388-L1558】【F:custom_components/pawcontrol/manifest.json†L1-L60】
4. **Quality scale evidence** – The checklist and documentation now declare the Bronze baseline with inline notes about outstanding items, matching the manifest metadata.【F:custom_components/pawcontrol/quality_scale.yaml†L1-L33】【F:README.md†L5-L1132】

### Remaining Observations

- End-to-end validation on a supervised Home Assistant installation is still pending; once executed, the resulting telemetry should be linked from the testing checklist so reviewers can trace the run.【F:docs/compliance_gap_analysis.md†L21-L23】【F:docs/performance_samples.md†L15-L34】
- The new analytics collector instrumentation will benefit from real-world sampling to confirm the CI benchmarks align with supervised installations and to populate a supervised snapshot next to the `ci` dataset.【F:docs/async_dependency_audit.md†L69-L112】【F:generated/perf_samples/latest.json†L1-L33】

### Testing & Validation Checklist

- [ ] Full integration test pass on Home Assistant 2025.9.1 nightly build
- [x] Config flow, options flow, and reauthentication exercised via unit suites
- [x] Pytest coverage instrumentation expanded to the full integration (reporting improvements still pending CI access)
- [ ] End-to-end smoke test on a supervised Home Assistant installation _(attach telemetry artefact link once executed)_

### Recommended Next Steps

1. Capture supervised-environment telemetry for the analytics collector metrics and compare it with the committed benchmarks.
2. Schedule an end-to-end regression run on a supervised Home Assistant instance before the next release to validate discovery and diagnostics flows under real conditions.
