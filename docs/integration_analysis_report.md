# PawControl Integration Analysis Report

The PawControl integration currently advertises the **Bronze** quality scale.
This report captures the existing strengths along with the gaps we must close
before pursuing higher tiers.

## Highlights
1. **Documentation foundations** – README and INSTALLATION cover setup and onboarding; additional troubleshooting and diagnostics content is planned.
2. **Service coverage** – Feeding services are documented. Garden, weather, notification, and diagnostics helpers still need documentation to satisfy Bronze.
3. **Config flow support** – The UI-driven config flow handles the base user path, but discovery, reconfigure, and reauth steps are unfinished.

## Gaps & Risks
1. **Runtime adoption** – Runtime data helpers need validation and tests to prove platforms use them consistently.
2. **Testing harness** – The Home Assistant compatibility stubs are incomplete, leaving the integration, coordinator, and diagnostics suites failing in constrained environments.
3. **Device lifecycle** – `async_remove_config_entry_device` requires tests to avoid removing active dogs and to document the cleanup process.

## Next Steps
1. Document every registered service in `custom_components/pawcontrol/services.yaml` and add real-world examples.
2. Finish the config flow steps and add regression tests for setup failures, reauth, and options flows.
3. Rebuild the Home Assistant stub harness so `pytest -q` can exercise component and integration suites, then restore coverage reporting in CI.
