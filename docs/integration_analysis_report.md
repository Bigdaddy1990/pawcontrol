# PawControl Integration Analysis Report

The PawControl integration advertises the **Platinum** quality scale. This report captures the strengths that sustain that posture along with ongoing monitoring areas.

## Highlights
1. **Documentation coverage** – README, INSTALLATION, MAINTENANCE, and the portal guides document setup, troubleshooting, diagnostics, repairs, and removal workflows.
2. **Service surface** – Feeding, garden, weather, notification, diagnostics, and resilience services are documented and validated by `services.yaml` plus targeted tests.
3. **Config flow maturity** – UI-driven configuration supports discovery, reconfigure, reauth, and options paths with localisation and regression coverage.

## Sustainment Focus
1. **Runtime adoption** – Continue verifying that new platforms consume the coordinator runtime managers and update tests when adapters evolve.
2. **Testing harness** – Maintain the Home Assistant stub harness so component, integration, diagnostics, and repair suites execute reliably with the coverage gate.
3. **Device lifecycle** – Periodically rerun device removal and reload tests to ensure active dogs remain intact and documentation reflects current behaviour.

## Next Steps
1. Extend `docs/testing/coverage_reporting.md` with the latest artefacts after each nightly run.
2. Track resilience UI and telemetry changes so diagnostics exports and dashboards remain aligned.
3. Review localisation diffs quarterly to catch drift between `strings.json` and the translated payloads.
