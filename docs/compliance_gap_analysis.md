# PawControl Quality Compliance Report

PawControl targets the **Platinum** tier of the Home Assistant Integration Quality Scale. This report consolidates the
instruction sets from `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `.gemini/styleguide.md`, and `.claude/agents/` with the evidence
now present in the repository to highlight which requirements are satisfied and which still need remediation.

## 1. Alignment with repository instructions
- ✅ **Async, typing, and runtime data** – The integration enforces shared aiohttp sessions, docstrings, and typed runtime
  storage as required by the Claude and Gemini guides.【F:info.md†L1-L76】【F:README.md†L1-L199】
- ✅ **Documentation traceability** – README, `info.md`, and the documentation portal cover installation, options,
  diagnostics, and removal steps as mandated by the Home Assistant documentation rules referenced in the Copilot guide.【F:README.md†L42-L199】【F:README.md†L320-L388】【F:docs/README.md†L1-L35】
- ⚠️ **Quality evidence curation** – `custom_components/pawcontrol/quality_scale.yaml` and the surrounding reports carry
  Platinum mappings, yet the quality scale badge and release artefacts still reflect Bronze history. These require updates
  once the outstanding blockers below are closed.【F:README.md†L5-L24】【F:README.md†L336-L380】

## 2. Platinum readiness snapshot
- ✅ **Config flow & options** – UI configuration, options flow parity, and translation coverage are documented and tested.【F:README.md†L292-L313】【F:docs/production_integration_documentation.md†L250-L353】
- ✅ **Diagnostics & repairs** – Diagnostics export anonymised data and repairs flows are described for reviewer validation.【F:README.md†L722-L741】【F:docs/diagnostik.md†L24-L48】
- ✅ **Testing discipline** – Ruff, pytest, and MyPy baselines are defined and linked from README and `dev.md`.【F:README.md†L24-L70】【F:dev.md†L5-L20】
- ✅ **Device removal** – `async_remove_config_entry_device` now guards stored dog projections (including options `dog_options`) and regression tests exercise runtime, data, and options pathways to prove only stale devices are removed.【F:custom_components/pawcontrol/__init__.py†L1515-L1598】【F:tests/components/pawcontrol/test_init.py†L1081-L1148】
- ⚠️ **Brand package** – Brand assets and upstream submissions are tracked but not yet finalised for Home Assistant’s brand repository.【F:README.md†L336-L380】
- ⚠️ **Coverage automation** – Coverage reports exist but the automated publication still needs wiring to CI once the HA harness stabilises.【F:README.md†L24-L70】【F:README.md†L320-L372】
- ✅ **Strict typing remediation** – `mypy custom_components/pawcontrol` now passes with zero issues across 74 source files, clearing the Platinum typing gate.【F:dev.md†L7-L11】【259eea†L1-L2】
- ✅ **Resilience UI validation** – The Platinum Lovelace statistics view now renders the resilience metrics markdown automatically, the README and quickstart highlight the block, and regression tests assert the card contains the coordinator counters.【F:README.md†L753-L780】【F:docs/resilience-quickstart.md†L181-L186】【F:tests/components/pawcontrol/test_dashboard_renderer.py†L56-L140】
- ⚠️ **Documentation synchronisation** – README and diagnostics guides highlight the resilience snapshot, yet the release artefacts must stay aligned whenever telemetry evolves.【F:README.md†L722-L741】【F:dev.md†L13-L20】

## 3. Markdown updates required for Home Assistant reviewers
- Add a release-note pointer in `RELEASE_NOTES.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` referencing the Platinum uplift once blocking tasks are
  complete so documentation and metadata remain in sync.
- Refresh badge assets in `README.md` to avoid advertising obsolete Bronze status when the manifest switches to Platinum.
- Keep `info.md` bilingual while ensuring the first section summarises installation, configuration, diagnostics, and removal
  in line with HACS guidance; the current structure already satisfies the checklist but should be revisited when new modules
  land.【F:info.md†L1-L120】
- Continue logging documentation updates in `docs/markdown_compliance_review.md` so reviewers can trace how Markdown aligns
  with Home Assistant’s custom integration requirements.【F:docs/markdown_compliance_review.md†L1-L120】

## 4. Next actions
1. Close the outstanding Platinum blockers (device removal, brand package, automated coverage, strict typing, resilience UI
   validation) and update the manifest badge set accordingly.
2. Expand the Markdown review document whenever new features alter installation, configuration, or troubleshooting steps, and
   document telemetry additions such as the rejection metrics summary at the same time.【F:dev.md†L13-L20】
3. Synchronise release artefacts, including `quality_scale.yaml`, with the evidence captured in README and support
   documentation to avoid drift across the repository.
