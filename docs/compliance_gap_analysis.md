# PawControl Quality Compliance Report

PawControl targets the **Platinum** tier of the Home Assistant Integration Quality Scale. This report consolidates the
instruction sets from `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `.gemini/styleguide.md`, and `.claude/agents/` with the evidence
now present in the repository to highlight which requirements are satisfied and which still need remediation.

## 1. Alignment with repository instructions
- ✅ **Async, typing, and runtime data** – The integration enforces shared aiohttp sessions, docstrings, and typed runtime
  storage as required by the Claude and Gemini guides.【F:info.md†L1-L76】【F:README.md†L1-L199】
- ✅ **Documentation traceability** – README, `info.md`, and the documentation portal cover installation, options,
  diagnostics, and removal steps as mandated by the Home Assistant documentation rules referenced in the Copilot guide.【F:README.md†L42-L199】【F:README.md†L320-L388】【F:docs/README.md†L1-L35】
- ⚠️ **Quality evidence curation** – `custom_components/pawcontrol/quality_scale.yaml` and the surrounding reports carry
  Platinum mappings, yet the quality scale badge and release artefacts still reflect Bronze history. These require updates
  once the outstanding blockers below are closed.【F:README.md†L5-L24】【F:README.md†L336-L380】

## 2. Platinum readiness snapshot
- ✅ **Config flow & options** – UI configuration, options flow parity, and translation coverage are documented and tested.
- ✅ **Diagnostics & repairs** – Diagnostics export anonymised data and repairs flows are described for reviewer validation.【F:README.md†L320-L372】【F:docs/production_integration_documentation.md†L250-L353】
- ✅ **Testing discipline** – Ruff, pytest, and MyPy baselines are defined and linked from README and `dev.md`.
- ⚠️ **Device removal** – `async_remove_config_entry_device` scenarios are listed as in-progress and require additional test
  fixtures to reach Platinum confidence.【F:dev.md†L1-L40】
- ⚠️ **Brand package** – Brand assets and upstream submissions are tracked but not yet finalised for Home Assistant’s brand
  repository.【F:README.md†L336-L380】
- ⚠️ **Coverage automation** – Coverage reports exist but the automated publication still needs wiring to CI once the HA
  harness stabilises.【F:README.md†L24-L70】【F:README.md†L320-L372】

## 3. Markdown updates required for Home Assistant reviewers
- Add a release-note pointer in `RELEASE_NOTES.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` referencing the Platinum uplift once blocking tasks are
  complete so documentation and metadata remain in sync.
- Refresh badge assets in `README.md` to avoid advertising obsolete Bronze status when the manifest switches to Platinum.
- Keep `info.md` bilingual while ensuring the first section summarises installation, configuration, diagnostics, and removal
  in line with HACS guidance; the current structure already satisfies the checklist but should be revisited when new modules
  land.【F:info.md†L1-L120】
- Continue logging documentation updates in `docs/markdown_compliance_review.md` so reviewers can trace how Markdown aligns
  with Home Assistant’s custom integration requirements.【F:docs/markdown_compliance_review.md†L1-L120】

## 4. Next actions
1. Close the outstanding Platinum blockers (device removal, brand package, automated coverage) and update the manifest badge
   set accordingly.
2. Expand the Markdown review document whenever new features alter installation, configuration, or troubleshooting steps.
3. Synchronise release artefacts, including `quality_scale.yaml`, with the evidence captured in README and support
   documentation to avoid drift across the repository.
