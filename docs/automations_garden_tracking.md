## ENTITY REQUIREMENTS

These automations require the following entities to be available through the PawControl integration:

### Garden Session Sensors
- `sensor.{dog_id}_garden_time_today`
- `sensor.{dog_id}_garden_sessions_today`
- `sensor.{dog_id}_garden_poop_count_today`
- `sensor.{dog_id}_last_garden_session`
- `sensor.{dog_id}_garden_activities_count`
- `sensor.{dog_id}_last_garden_duration`
- `sensor.{dog_id}_last_garden_session_hours`

### Binary Sensors
- `binary_sensor.{dog_id}_garden_session_active`
- `binary_sensor.garden_door`
- `binary_sensor.garden_gate_open`

### Motion Sensors (Optional)
- `binary_sensor.motion_garden_play_area`
- `binary_sensor.motion_garden_digging_spot`

### Weather Integration
- `weather.home`
- `sensor.outdoor_temperature`

### Services
- `pawcontrol.start_garden_session`
- `pawcontrol.end_garden_session`
- `pawcontrol.add_garden_activity`
- `pawcontrol.confirm_garden_poop`

## IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

1. **Door Sensor Setup**: Configure door sensors for garden access points
2. **Motion Detection**: Optional motion sensors for activity detection
3. **Weather Integration**: Ensure weather integration is configured
4. **Notification Actions**: Customize based on your mobile app setup
5. **Dog ID**: Replace "buddy" with your actual dog ID throughout
6. **Time Zones**: Adjust trigger times for your local timezone
7. **Temperature Units**: Adjust temperature thresholds for your units (¬∞C/¬∞F)

## CUSTOMIZATION

These automations can be customized by:
- Modifying session timeout durations
- Adjusting temperature and weather thresholds
- Adding custom garden zones and activities
- Integrating with smart garden devices
- Creating breed-specific behavior patterns
- Adding health condition considerations
