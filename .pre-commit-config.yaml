  # Use Ruff for linting and formatting Python files.  The ``ruff-check`` hook
  # previously used ``--exit-non-zero-on-fix`` which caused pre‑commit to
  # repeatedly re-run fixes without ever reporting success.  By removing
  # ``--exit-non-zero-on-fix`` we allow Ruff to apply fixes and exit cleanly
  # once done.  ``--show-fixes`` still prints a summary of what was changed.

  # Pyupgrade modernises syntax to the target minimum version.  The

  # The dedicated reorder-python-imports hook is removed because it clashes
  # with Ruff’s import sorting. Ruff will handle import ordering on its own.



  # autopep8 has been removed; Ruff’s formatter and pyupgrade cover its scope.


  # The add-trailing-comma hook is removed because Ruff’s formatting handles
  # trailing commas consistently.

  # Run mypy with the project’s configuration.  We keep the hook but
  # relax the configuration in ``pyproject.toml`` to avoid an unmanageable
  # flood of type errors (see that file for details).
