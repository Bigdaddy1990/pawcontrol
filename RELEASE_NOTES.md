# PawControl v1.0.0 - Production Release Notes

**Release Date:** September 8, 2025
**Environment:** Home Assistant 2025.9.1+ | Python 3.13+ | Quality Scale Platinum

---

## üéâ Production Release - Platinum Sustainment Achieved

**PawControl v1.0.0** delivers the first public release of the smart dog management integration for Home Assistant. The milestone ships with complete runtime data adoption, documentation, branding, and automated test coverage to sustain the Platinum quality scale declaration.

## üèÜ Key Achievements

### ‚úÖ **Quality Baseline**
- **Automated Tests:** A growing suite of unit and integration tests (many still require Home Assistant stubs to run outside a full core environment)
- **Quality Scale:** Platinum declaration with evidence tracked in `custom_components/pawcontrol/quality_scale.yaml`
- **HACS Path:** Repository layout aligns with expectations, but brand assets and review are still pending
- **Documentation:** Installation and core service guides are published; diagnostics and maintenance docs remain TODOs

### ‚úÖ **Enterprise Architecture**
- **10 Platforms:** Complete HA platform coverage
- **150+ Entities:** Comprehensive smart pet management
- **Multi-Dog Support:** Unlimited dogs with independent configurations
- **Performance Optimized:** <100MB memory, <5s setup time

---

## üöÄ What's New in v1.0.0

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Options Flow Improvements**
- Added manual escalation selectors to the System Settings step so `manual_check_event`, `manual_guard_event`, and `manual_breaker_event` can be managed directly from the UI; saved values are trimmed, blank inputs disable triggers, and all Resilience blueprint automations receive the update instantly.„ÄêF:custom_components/pawcontrol/options_flow.py‚Ä†L3986-L4043„Äë„ÄêF:custom_components/pawcontrol/script_manager.py‚Ä†L503-L607„Äë„ÄêF:tests/unit/test_options_flow.py‚Ä†L808-L870„Äë

### ü©∫ **Diagnostics Enhancements**
- Resilience snapshots now expose the active manual escalation listeners and capture the latest manual trigger context (event type, origin, user, payload, age) so on-call responders can see exactly which on-demand check executed most recently.„ÄêF:custom_components/pawcontrol/script_manager.py‚Ä†L575-L704„Äë„ÄêF:custom_components/pawcontrol/script_manager.py‚Ä†L1235-L1363„Äë„ÄêF:tests/components/pawcontrol/test_diagnostics.py‚Ä†L214-L243„Äë„ÄêF:tests/unit/test_data_manager.py‚Ä†L595-L676„Äë
